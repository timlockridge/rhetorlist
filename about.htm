<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>Rhetorlist is my attempt to track new book releases (scholarly monographs and edited collections) in writing research. I've too often missed the announcement for a great new book, only to find it months (or years!) later. By building a website that lists new books, I hope that I can solve my problem—and help others hear about new book-length research in the field. I hope you find it useful.</p>
<h4>Why isn't [insert subject/subdiscipline/area-of-inquiry] included?</h4>
<p>I have no interest in policing the boundaries of writing, rhetoric, and literacy-related research. If you think a book should be included, please use the <a href="submit.htm">new book form</a>. I'm happy to add it.</p>
<h4>Do I have to come back to this site to see updates?</h4>
<p>If you use an RSS Feed Reader that supports JSON Feed (I recommend <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a>; if you'd prefer a free service, try <a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly</a>), you can subscribe to this site and get updates when a new book is posted! Just point your feed reader to <a href="https://rhetorlist.net/feed.json">this site's JSON Feed</a>.</p>
<h4>What is OA and why is it a column?</h4>
<p>Open Access. I believe in celebrating and circulating open access work, so I've chosen to highlight it here. And if you want something to immediately read, you can sort the table for OA books (desktop browsers only—mobile sizes offer limited filtering due to screen size constraints).</p>
<h4>Why aren't you including articles, book reviews, or other scholarly forms?</h4>
<p>I think it's much easier to find new articles than to find newly published books. Also: Tracking other scholarly forms would greatly increase the complexity of this project, and I am but one person.</p>
<h4>Have you thought about adding more info to the table?</h4>
<p>I have. I hope to add more information in the future.</p>
<h4>Can I use the data for my own research project?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. I hope that, over time, this site can tell us a bit about how our field produces monographs. If there's anything I can do to help, please email me.</p>
<h4>How did you make this?</h4>
<p>All of the data is kept in a json file. The table is built with the wonderful <a href="http://tabulator.info/">Tabulator javascript library</a>.</p>
<h4>Can I make a variation of this for my scholarly field?</h4>
<p>Sure. If you know a bit of HTML, the setup for this site is quite simple, and the source is <a href="https://github.com/timlockridge/rhetorlist">on Github</a>. Feel free to hack at my work and make it your own!</p>
<h4>Who maintains this?</h4>
