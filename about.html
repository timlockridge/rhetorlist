<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>Rhetorlist is my attempt to track new book releases (scholarly monographs and edited collections) in writing research. I've too often missed the announcement for a great new book, only to find it months (or years!) later. By building a website that lists new books, I hope that I can solve my problem—and help others hear about new book-length research in the field. I hope you find it useful. You can read more about the project's initial design in <a href="https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/24.2/disputatio/lockridge/index.html">Building Rhetorlist</a>.</p>
<h4>Why isn't [insert subject/subdiscipline/area-of-inquiry] included?</h4>
<p>I have no interest in policing the boundaries of writing, rhetoric, and literacy-related research. If you think a book should be included, please use the <a href="submit.html">new book form</a>. I'm happy to add it.</p>
<h4>Do I have to come back to this site to see updates?</h4>
<p>If you use an RSS Feed Reader that supports JSON Feed (I recommend <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a>; if you'd prefer a free option, try <a href="https://netnewswire.com">Net News Wire</a> or <a href="https://www.inoreader.com">Inoreader</a>), you can subscribe to this site and get updates when a new book is posted! Just point your feed reader to <a href="https://rhetorlist.net/feed.json">this site's JSON Feed</a>.</p>
<h4>What is OA and why is it a filter option?</h4>
<p>Open Access. I believe in celebrating and circulating open access work, so I've chosen to highlight it here. And if you want something to immediately read, you can sort the Availability filter for OA books.</p>
<h4>Why aren't you including articles, book reviews, or other scholarly forms?</h4>
<p>I think it's much easier to find new articles than to find newly published books. Also: Tracking other scholarly forms would greatly increase the complexity of this project, and I am but one person.</p>
<h4>Can I use the data for my own research project?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. I hope that, over time, this site can tell us a bit about how our field produces monographs. If there's anything I can do to help, please email me.</p>
<h4>There's a lot of information here. How is it stored?</h4>
<p>I'm storing the site's data in json files. If you'd like to view and tinker, visit the project's repository <a href="https://github.com/timlockridge/rhetorlist">on Github</a>.</p>
<h4>Can I make a variation of this for my scholarly field?</h4>
<p>Sure! Clone the Github repository and make it your own.</p>
<h4>How did you make this?</h4>
<p>I buiilt the intial version of Rhetorlist (in 2018) with a javascript table library. In 2025 I shifted to a cover-based design, which I made with a lot of help from Claude Code and my coffee maker.</p>
